### The Bus - Pyramid ###

# The game goes as follows:
# 4 rounds of guessing a specific characteristic of a card
# A pyramid in which you need to gamble to get rid of your cards
# The players who have cards left from the pyramid play guessing the cards on the Bus

# In detail:
# Round 1: Every player guesses the color of the card they are going to receive (red or black). When guessed wright you can distribute one sip, otherwise you drink 1 sip
# Round 2: Guess if the card you are going to receive is going to be higher or lower (ace highest / 2 lowest) then the card you received from round 1. When correct you distribute 2 sips, otherwise you drink 2 sips.
# Round 3: Guess if the card you are going to receive is going to be within or outside of the range of cards you have received in the previous two rounds (ex. you picked a 5 and a queen. Your next card will be a 3. This is outside the range. A 7 would be within the range). When correct you distribute 3 sips, otherwise you drink 3 sips.
# Round 4: Guess if the card you are going to receive is (not) of the same type that you have already received. When correct you distribute 4 sips, otherwise you drink 4 sips.
